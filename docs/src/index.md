## Overview

This Julia module exports a function `jim`
(jiffy image display)
for convenient display of a grayscale image.

This function was originally designed
for the Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox
[(MIRT)](https://github.com/JeffFessler/MIRT.jl)
where most results
are images that one will want to display.

Also exported is the `prompt` function that
(by default)
pauses for a user to press a key before continuing,
which is useful in scripts.

See the "Examples" for details.
